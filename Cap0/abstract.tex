Micro Air Vehicle Link is an simple open source protocol that has become popular in applications envolving small unmanned aircraft as drones. The protocol is also known for the lack of strong security measures once that is focused on lightweight communication over a bandwith-constrained channel. This paper overviews the main security issues of the protocol presented in the literature as lack of encryption, implementation flaws and vulnerability to network attacks.
The analysis is supported by software-in-the-loop simulations using the Ardupilot project. Besides this work presents the main aspects to understand the MAVLink protocol and the steps necessary to configure the simulation environment in order to reproduce the analysis.
