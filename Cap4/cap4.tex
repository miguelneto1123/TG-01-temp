%\section{Conclus√£o}
After setting up the simulation environment and studying about MAVLink, the next steps is to check in the literature the main complains about MAVLink security in order to start to develop a more structured analysis. The analysis aims to exploit MAVLink vulnerabilities inside simulations in order to sustain conclusions.

During this process is expected to expand the MAVLink documentation this work want to present, including examples of normal use of the protocol in simulated environment. All the necessary steps to reproduce the simulations in other computers will be presented in order to help in related projects.
